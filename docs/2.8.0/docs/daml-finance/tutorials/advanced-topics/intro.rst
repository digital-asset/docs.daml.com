Advanced Topics
###############

This section covers some advanced Daml Finance topics, helping you model complex use-cases and
scenarios.

The following tutorials are available:

* The :doc:`Intermediated Lifecycling <lifecycling/intermediated-lifecycling>` tutorial demonstrates how to
  lifecycle a generic instrument with an intermediary party between the issuer and the investor.
* The :doc:`Contingent Claims Instrument <instrument-modeling/contingent-claims-instrument>` tutorial describes how to
  create a new contingent-claim-based instrument type (similar to the bond instruments that you saw in the Bond Extension
  tutorial).
* The :doc:`On ledger vs on-the-fly <instrument-modeling/contingent-claims-on-ledger-vs-on-the-fly>` tutorial helps you
  to decide whether to explicitly store the claims tree on the ledger or generate it on-the-fly.
