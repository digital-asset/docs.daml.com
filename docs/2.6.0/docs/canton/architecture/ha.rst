High Availability
=================

This section describes how Canton can be run with high availability (HA).
Support for HA is being added to the Canton components gradually. The specifics
and configuration of HA for each component will be filled in as the
implementation is completed. Furthermore, we are mostly starting with cold and
warm standby solutions, and will gradually move to hot standby and active-active
solutions to improve the mean time to recovery.
