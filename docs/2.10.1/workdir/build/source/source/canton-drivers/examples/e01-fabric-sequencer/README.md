# Canton Fabric Integration

The Canton-on-Fabric integration runs a Canton domain where events are sequenced using the Hyperledger Fabric ledger.

The folder `canton-on-fabric` contains pre-packaged docker-compose files to run Canton with a Fabric domain,
as well as supporting scripts and the documentation.

Check [Fabric Domain](https://docs.daml.com/canton/usermanual/domains/fabric.html) for instructions for this demo and
broader Fabric Sequencer usage.

Check [Enterprise Domain Integrations](https://docs.daml.com/canton/usermanual/domains/domains.html) for
detailed information on sequencer configuration and connecting to external sequencers.
