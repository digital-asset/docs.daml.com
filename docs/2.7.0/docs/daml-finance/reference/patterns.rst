Patterns
########

This page explains some common design patterns used in the Daml Finance library.

.. _factory-concept:

Factory concept
---------------

Factories are helper contracts that are used to create instruments, holdings and other important
contracts like lifecycle rules and effects. The reason why using factories is a recommended pattern
when using Daml Finance has to do with application decoupling / upgradeability of your application.

For example, suppose that you are writing Daml code to issue equity instruments. Your workflow would
reference the
:ref:`Equity implementation package <module-daml-finance-instrument-equity-instrument-69265>` v0.2.1
and at some point do a
``create Equity.Instrument with issuer = myParty, id = "MyCompany", ..`` to create the instrument.

If the equity package gets updated to v0.2.2 and a new field is added to the instrument (or a choice
is changed, or a new lifecycle event is added, â€¦) then you are forced to upgrade your Daml code in
order to use the new feature and will have to deal with upgrading multiple templates on the ledger.

A safer approach is for your Daml code to only reference the
:ref:`Equity interface package <module-daml-finance-interface-instrument-equity-instrument-13224>`,
which contains interface definitions and is updated less frequently.

However, you would now need a way to create equity instruments without referencing
Daml.Finance.Instrument.Equity in your main Daml workflow. To do this, you can setup a Script to run
during ledger initialisation that will create a
:ref:`factory contract <module-daml-finance-instrument-equity-factory-96899>`
and cast it to the corresponding
:ref:`interface <module-daml-finance-interface-instrument-equity-factory-97140>`.
You can then use the factory in your main workflow code to create the instruments.

When an upgraded instrument comes along, you would need to write code to archive the old factory and
create the new one, in order to issue the new instruments. However, the Daml code for your workflow
could in principle stay untouched.

For an example on where the Factory pattern is used, check out the
:doc:`Getting Started <../tutorials/getting-started>` tutorials.

.. _getview:

View of an interface contract and the `GetView` choice
------------------------------------------------------

There are different ways to access the data of a contract, for example the terms of an instrument:

#. :ref:`fetch <daml-ref-fetch>` the interface contract using its contract ID (this requires the
   submitting party to be a stakeholder of the contract). It is then possible to use the ``view``
   built-in method to get the interface view.
#. ``GetView``: by calling this choice on the interface, for example on a
   :ref:`callable bond <type-daml-finance-interface-instrument-bond-callable-instrument-instrument-70770>`,
   a party can get the view of a contract, without necessarily being a stakeholder of the contract.
   This can be useful in situations where someone needs access to reference data, but should not be
   a stakeholder of the contract. Specifically, if *publicParty* is an observer of an instrumentCid,
   a party would only require readAs rights of *publicParty* in order to exercise ``GetView``. In
   the Daml Finance library, this choice has been implemented not only for instruments but also for
   other types of contracts, e.g.
   :ref:`Holdings <module-daml-finance-interface-holding-fungible-63712>` and lifecycle related
   contracts like
   :ref:`Rule <module-daml-finance-interface-lifecycle-rule-lifecycle-50431>` and
   :ref:`Effect <module-daml-finance-interface-lifecycle-effect-16050>`.
